                            <h2>NightTrader OTC Buy and Sell Instructions</h2>   

                          <p>
                          Casa de cambio should have a computer and clean browser with no plugins other than Metamask installed.
                            They should also have a tablet where the window is with a cutout over where the QR displays and any relevant rates exposed.
                            The operator should also have a camera that can be activated by the computer accessing the browser.</p>
                            
                            
                            <h4>Cashier interaction with sell calculator:</h4>
                        <p>They should put their email which will identify them for payment. Also they can set the exchange rate at the beginning
                            of the day. Because Bitso gives a higher rate there is an arbitrage so their clients benefit from the street rate.
                            The CASA de cambio can sell BTC/ETH and anything else we add. Also they can denominate in Bitcoin, pesos or USD
                            and no matter what they put the calculator figures out the price in USD. However they should always make sure client
                            is in agreement with rates. This applies to both sell and buy calculator. Some clients might want a receipt of
                            the transaction sent to them which is optional and there is a field for that. Also any extra emails to CC can
                            be put there as well. If more filtered email is needed we can set that up in the future.</p>
                            
                            <h4> When a user is selling crypto:</h4>
                        <p>User can bid on Ethereum or Bitcoin and will see all data and QR. Please try to get the funds sent long before the bid expires.
                            When a bid is made it is not confirmed until sent via email and the funds physically sent from the seller.
                            Then NT will send the funds to the casa de cambio. They should wait for those funds to confirm to release cash.
                            They can have an open tab to check smart contract history on etherescan to see the deposit. NT should confirm with them.
                            They can also see the DAI balance change by refreshing it in the buy calculator or confirming with NT.
                            Also it's important to mention that Metamask doesn't track the smart contract address where the DAI is held although the cashier
                            is the authorized spender of that contract. This is why logging in and also checking on Etherscan lets the cashier know.</p>
                            
                            
                        <h4>Casa de cambio logging into buy calculator:</h4>
                        <p>They will enter an email and password to generate the key and check balances the same as when they registered. This calculator will make
                            sure the buyer can't bid more than they hold in DAI. Also Ethereum will be required to be kept at a minimum level.
                            When they log in for the first time the browser will ask them permission to connect Metamask and they should agree and keep it unlocked.
                            Here they can also fill up with some Ethereum for gas and see history of transactions. Please note when sending transactions Metamask
                            might tell them that it will cost a few dollars in gas. However the actual cost will be lower usually as gas gets refunded. If for
                            whatever reason they have trouble sending us a transaction in times of high traffic we can raise the gas limit for the software.
                            It's possible in the future we could estimate those costs based on current gas rates and what the average transaction consumes.</p>
                            
                            <h4>When a user is buying crypto:</h4>
                        <p>User will get the quote and then they can either scan a QR code or type their address manually which either way they will confirm with
                            the cashier. Then after everything is confirmed and agreed to the cashier sends the email with the information to NT and sends the
                            DAI and confirms everything with Metamask. Metamask may say it's around 5-20 dollars to send but in actuality it ends up costing only
                            a couple dollars at the most(it's because of gas estimation). Once the trade is performed funds are sent to the user and NT will
                            send a transaction ID via email or text message.</p>
                              
                            <h4>Lock/Unlock:</h4>
                        <p> A very important aspect to the smart contract is limiting liabilities so that there is no risk of theft or the accusation of hacking. The owner
                            and cashier should be aware of this feature. This is why the smart contract is only capable of trading. In addition there is a locking feature
                            which prevents the minter who created the contract from making changes for 6 months. This timelock is a good failsafe if cashier loses their
                            account access at least funds can be recovered. Also it protects the client from the minter making changes to destination addresses without
                            mutual consent. This way, a hacker can never send funds anywhere that isn't intended. Funds simply must go to the designated accounts and only
                            those accounts which is usually just an exchange or the owner of the Casa de Cambio. The cashier is warned if the account is unlocked and
                            if the lock is about to expire within the month. This gives time for the lock to be renewed. Also the cashier can type "unlock" as a command
                            similar to previous commands when logged in and this will send a transaction to make it possible to modify things like destination accounts.
                            NT is able to create the lock through remix after all the details are agreed to and accounts confirmed during setup.</p>
                        <h4> 
                            Withdraw to owner:</h4>
                        <p>The owner of the Casa de Cambio may choose to liquidate his DAI or take some of his DAI away from the trading account. This is a smart decision
                            when he knows his daily volume and a great idea for security. However the Ethereum gas fees might be paid by the owner especially if done
                            frequently. The owner can keep DAI in his personal account and only release to a cashier when needed although it's definitely recommended
                            he has some funds ready for the day at the cashier account. The owner however must be extremely cautious when sending funds back to the cashier
                            he must send ONLY to a whitelisted address specifically the smart contract address and absolutely NOT the address that holds the Ethereum.
                            Doing so can cost him if the cashier is corrupt especially because the private key to that account is easily accessible. The address in Metamask
                            is the same one as when the cashier logs in and that address can just be used for gas for receiving Ethereum which is small amounts.
                            So for the cashier to send to the owner they have to simply type "withdraw" in the "address" field. Then they type the amount in the buy amount
                            field and then click to send the DAI. The owner can see the smart contract address in the email generated by the buy calculator. However
                            ultimately he should have those addresses stored in a file (same whitelist file that NT holds) knowing those are the contract addresses.</p>
